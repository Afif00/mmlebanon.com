## Install

First of all, make sure you install nodeJS (https://nodejs.org/en/)

Then open your terminal to get to the folder mmlebanon.com that you've just downloaded & type:
```bash
npm install
```

This will generate a folder named node_modules in mmlebanon.com.

Then, just type:
```bash
npm run start
```
This will compile the files & open the browser. You'll be able to see the website in your localhost.
If you make any changes on the HTML or the CSS files, the page will automatically reload.

If you do not want the auto-reload, type:
```bash
npm run dev
```
instead of npm run start.

## Usage

HTML files: ./src/templates
SCSS files: ./src/styles
JS files: ./src/js
ASSETS: ./src/assets (this is where you store the images, the fonts etc.)
