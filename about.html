                    <p>Meghterbin Mejtemiin supports and facilitates activities and initiatives towards social, economic, political and environmental justice.</p>
                    <p>We stand firmly with:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Outing of the sectarian and classist system in all of its forms and institutions</li>
                        <li>Abolishing the sectarian and patriarchal society which oppresses women, the LGBTQ+ community, people with disability, migrants, refugees and working-class citizens.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We support and work towards:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Implementing secularism at all levels of governance.</li>
                        <li>Imposing pure legal reform and independent judiciary.</li>
                        <li>Unifying the diaspora/immigrants/expats by collective activism.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We work inter-sectionally and believe in the interconnectedness of multiple struggles, such as but not limited to the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We view racism in Lebanon as embedded in the daily struggle of refugees and migrant workers for dignity and basic rights.</li>
                        <li>We refuse the instrumentalization of Palestinian and Syrian refugees for political leverage and the continuous violation of their human rights and dignity.</li>
                        <li>We support the Palestinian cause and their movement towards freedom and civil rights.
                        </li>
