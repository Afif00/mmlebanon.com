                <p>Since the early days of the October 17 revolution, Lebanese people across 50+ cities in 25 countries have mobilized together to amplify the voices from the streets of Lebanon throughout the world. Just like revolutionaries in Lebanon,
                    we come from all social, economic, geographical, and confessional backgrounds and are all united against the corrupt political and sectarian system.
                </p>

                </div>
                <p>Generation after generation, we were forced to leave our families, friends, homes, and everything we love behind to build a more secure life elsewhere. Our minds and hearts remain in Lebanon as we have moved, adapted, and integrated
                    into our host countries. We have experienced how governments are supposed to work and care for their citizens and residents. We refuse to accept that it is normal for our families and friends to live without economic security,
                    electricity, clean water, a clean environment, pension plans, a fair justice system, and public services. We refuse to accept that nepotism, favoritism, and sectarianism are innate to our Lebanese culture. These major problems
                    are nothing but consequences of the corrupt sectarian system that has been ruling Lebanon for the past 40 years. That is why we strongly believe that through our global collective engagement and actions, we can transform Lebanon
                    into the country that we all dream of.
                </p>
                <p>The Lebanese diaspora, estimated at 10+ million around the world, has historically been a major contributor to Lebanon’s economy. However, our nostalgic attachment and our economic contributions are not sufficient anymore. The Lebanese
                    diaspora is currently engaged more than ever in Lebanese politics. With our rights to vote from abroad granted in 2017, we could now become a major player in driving the change in Lebanon.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-7 pl-md-5 d-flex justify-content-center flex-column">
                <p class="text-justify">Since 2019 we have raised the voices and demands of Lebanese revolutionaries through global protests and lobbying at international organizations and governments. We have been closely contributing by talking about Lebanon, fundraising
                    for Lebanon, sending medical supplies and other basic necessities, and engaging the diaspora through webinars and local events.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="col-md-12 pl-md-5">
                <p>Our involvement in the revolution does not stop here; we aim to continue this work, to reach the silent majority of the diaspora who are still unaware of their important role in reconstructing Lebanon, especially through the upcoming
                    parliamentary elections. By organizing ourselves, we are building communities of like-minded people everywhere who believe in a secular, fair and inclusive Lebanon. With our numbers and resources, we can use our synergy to shake
                    up the Lebanese political scene. We will employ our skills, backgrounds, resources, and networks to support the revolution at home in any way possible.</p>
                <p style='font-weight: bold;'>Now is the time to transform Lebanon’s brain drain into brain gain and drive the change in Lebanon through a unified global revolution.</p>
